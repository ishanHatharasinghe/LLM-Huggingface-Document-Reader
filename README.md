Explanation of the Code
This code sets up a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to create an intelligent chatbot capable of answering questions using a combination of PDF data and general knowledge. Below is a breakdown of its functionality:

Key Components of the Code
1. Environment Setup
os and pathlib: Handle file paths and environment variables.
dotenv.load_dotenv(): Loads the .env file containing sensitive information, such as API tokens.
os.environ['HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN']: Fetches the Hugging Face API token for authenticating with the Hugging Face platform.
2. Language Model Initialization
HuggingFaceHub: Connects to the Hugging Face repository to load the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model.
The model is configured for short, precise responses by setting parameters such as min_length, max_length, and temperature.
3. PDF Data Loading and Processing
PyPDFLoader: Loads a PDF file (Coronavirus.pdf) and extracts its text.
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter: Splits the extracted text into smaller chunks (1000 characters) for better processing by the language model.
4. Embedding and Vector Store
HuggingFaceEmbeddings: Converts chunks of text into numerical vectors using the sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2 model.
FAISS: Stores these embeddings in a vector database to facilitate efficient similarity searches.
5. Retriever Creation
The retriever uses FAISS to fetch the most relevant text chunks for a given question.
6. System Prompt
Defines the behavior of the chatbot:
Uses loaded data to answer.
If no relevant information is found, it responds with "no idea" and provides a separate general knowledge answer.
Limits responses to 20 words.
7. Prompt Template
Creates a structured template for interactions between the system and the user.
8. Question-Answering Mechanism
History Tracking: Maintains a history of previous questions and answers.
qa Function: Combines history and the retriever to generate a response:
If no relevant information is found, returns "no idea" along with a general knowledge response.
9. Chains and Retrieval-Augmented Generation
create_stuff_documents_chain: Combines retrieved documents to generate answers.
create_retrieval_chain: Builds a chain that retrieves relevant documents and generates an answer using the model.
Why Use This Code?
Efficient Information Retrieval:

Retrieves relevant sections of a document rather than processing the entire PDF every time, making the system faster and more scalable.
Accurate Responses:

Combines information retrieval with generative AI, ensuring the chatbot answers based on loaded data, supplemented with general knowledge if needed.
Customizable Behavior:

The system prompt and template allow fine-tuning of the chatbot's behavior, ensuring concise and context-specific responses.
Versatility:

The pipeline can handle both specific PDF-based queries and general questions.
History Preservation:

Tracks previous interactions, which can be used for context-aware conversations.
How to Use This Code
Setup:

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (e.g., langchain, transformers, sentence-transformers, FAISS).
Place the PDF file (Coronavirus.pdf) in the specified path.
Create a .env file containing your Hugging Face API token:
makefile
Copy code
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_token
Run the Script:

Execute the script in a Python environment.
Interact with the System:

Use the load_pdf_and_answer() function to ask questions about the loaded data:
python
Copy code
answer = load_pdf_and_answer("What is coronavirus?")
print(answer)
Customize:

Modify the system prompt or template to adjust the chatbot's behavior.
Replace the PDF or embedding model for other use cases.
Code Features in Practice
PDF Answering: For a question like "What are the symptoms of coronavirus?", the retriever fetches relevant sections of the PDF, and the model generates a precise answer.

Fallback to General Knowledge: If the PDF lacks information (e.g., "What is the capital of France?"), the chatbot responds with "no idea" followed by a general knowledge answer.

By integrating these components, the code creates a powerful and flexible information retrieval system!
